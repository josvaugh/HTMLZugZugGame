		Look at that! You scared them two of them off! Now it's an easy kill! </br>
		Zug Zug ended up making that hide after all, look at it! </br>
		It reminds me of an arnament my friend Lexxar wears, weird guy. </br>
		Looks like there some Ayleid ruins down in the valley, they normally have creatures </br>
		such as demons, woodland creatures and the undead near them... Feel brave enough to explore it? </br>
		Then there's a nice brush of trees you can explore as well if you aren't feeling like meeting something dangerous? </br>
