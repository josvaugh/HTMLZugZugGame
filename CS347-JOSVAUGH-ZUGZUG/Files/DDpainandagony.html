	Two is always better than one right? These are fine blades indeed </br>
	Keep this between you and I, but there's this shady Human by the name of Nigel, </br>
	That would probably assisinate myself and Zug Zug if we do not end up selling this to him. </br>
	He comes by our shop in the middle of the night to mark "DON'T MAKE ME USE MY HASTE!" on our door</br>
	We would rather not die, so we tolerate him... </br>
