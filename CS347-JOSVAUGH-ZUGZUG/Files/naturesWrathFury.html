	Aren't these two a beaut? With both combined, it would definitely hurt on the other end. </br>
	I believe one of our noblest of customers Velcie might want to give them a whirl </br>
	but he's been practicing the art of Shields lately so he may not need them... </br>
	Then there's our friend Seiki who works as a totem dancer, needing a better occupation other than </br>
	putting Earthy Shields on people all day; this might make his day, besides Velcie can always make his own! </br>
