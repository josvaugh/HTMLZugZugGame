	What a fine bow! Zug Zug will probably end up selling this to his dear friend Amarilys. </br>
	He's an expert huntsman and desires a new bow after all, or else he'll gaze deep into your soul </br>
	with his friend "The Soup", tormenting you. They also creep out the village animals... </br>
	Let's hope it'll ward them off? </br>
