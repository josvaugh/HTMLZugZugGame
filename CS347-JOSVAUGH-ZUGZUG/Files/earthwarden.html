	This mace is incredibly heavy and certainly terrifying! </br>
	Too bad it's only good for those tree loving Druid Folk... What a waste. </br>
	I know a Druid that calls himself "Lunar Life", yeah I know it's a hippy name, stupid right? </br>
	He might use it, but we won't sell it for cheap though since there's not many Druids </br>
	like him with a super high dodge rating in combat. Can't dodge a fireball though! *Bursts into Laughter*</br>
