	There we go! All better, Zug Zug ended up stiching his wounds and eating some wolf meat </br>
	he obtained from the last encounter... </br>
	It appears there's a cluster of tree's ahead of Zug Zug or you can try going back to the Worg's Lair </br>
	And check to see if their is anything rare in it! You're also ready to fight so what is there to lose? </br>
	</p>
