	A crossbow made of Antlers; That's a kicker! </br>
	There's this lone huntsman that always comes to our shop by the name of Belfaz... </br>
	He stares at you with a blank face and never even speaks to you, but deep inside you know </br>
	he means well and is sincere. He definetely doesn't go out into Basins, Valleys and Gulches killing innocent individuals. </br>
