		Zug Zug the Orc with the Pet Rock named Noshia... </br>
		Yes he has a pet rock, he claims it giggles at him when he does immature acts and it rolls around on top of his fur pelts at night... </br>
		Some think the rock is crazier than him, but it's a matter of perspective right? It's harmless... or is it? </br>
		He's also known as the Ladies Man and most importantly the village weaponsmith! </br>
		He has his own shop and is in need of a quest to find more rare minerals in order to craft rare epic weapons! </br>
		Not only that, Zug Zug loves to collect weapons in order to train and fight with them since he is also a Master of Arm's, can't you tell by those muscles? </br>
		He isn't called the Ladies Man for nothing! </br>
		Now, onwards! Help Zug Zug find something rare and epic to craft his next weapon! </br>
