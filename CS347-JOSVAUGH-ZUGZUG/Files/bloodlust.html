	Think Zug Zug is a touch guy don't you? Well yeah he is! Just don't touch his rock! </br>
	Just let him do his work, he'll be done in a second.. </br>
	*1 MINUTE LATER* </br>
	See? Didn't take long, but wow they did a number on him! Do you think he should rest? </br>
	Or do you think you can go take out the rest in that nearby cave they came from to be safe? </br>
