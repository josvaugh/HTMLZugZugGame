	Would you look at the size of that thing? Imagine a dwarf carrying it... Wait! </br>
	There's an old hermit nearby our village who happens to be a dwarf... He calls himself... "Jerry Garcia"?
	We don't normally meddle with dwarves, </br>
	However I know he can be lustful towards power and will give you a fine amount of Gold for this weapon! </br>
