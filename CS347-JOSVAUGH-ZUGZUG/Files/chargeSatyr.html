		Annnnnnnnnnnd Zug Zug flat out killed him... had the head roll and everything... Warlocks and their petty Dark Magic </br>
		He didn't even have armour! Just that Robe, us Orc's just call them dresses... Weaklings </br>
		Ah! That's why he was so defiant; He was guarding this here chest! Let's take a peak... </br>
		We found a rare mineral! This Satyr was safeguarding some Dark Iron! The quest has ended, you're free! </br>
		But first, what will  Zug Zug craft? </br>
